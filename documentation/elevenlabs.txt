Authentication

API Keys
The ElevenLabs API uses API keys for authentication. Every request to the API must include your API key, used to authenticate your requests and track usage quota.

Each API key can be scoped to one of the following:

Scope restriction: Set access restrictions by limiting which API endpoints the key can access.
Credit quota: Define custom credit limits to control usage.
Remember that your API key is a secret. Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps).

All API requests should include your API key in an xi-api-key HTTP header as follows:

xi-api-key: ELEVENLABS_API_KEY

Making requests
You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY with your secret API key.

curl 'https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/models' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'xi-api-key: $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY'

Example with the elevenlabs Python package:

from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
client = ElevenLabs(
  api_key='YOUR_API_KEY',
)

Example with the elevenlabs Node.js package:

import { ElevenLabsClient } from 'elevenlabs';
const client = new ElevenLabsClient({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
});

API REFERENCE
Streaming

The ElevenLabs API supports real-time audio streaming for select endpoints, returning raw audio bytes (e.g., MP3 data) directly over HTTP using chunked transfer encoding. This allows clients to process or play audio incrementally as it is generated.

Our official Node and Python libraries include utilities to simplify handling this continuous audio stream.

Streaming is supported for the Text to Speech API, Voice Changer API & Audio Isolation API. This section focuses on how streaming works for requests made to the Text to Speech API.

In Python, a streaming request looks like:

from elevenlabs import stream
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
client = ElevenLabs()
audio_stream = client.text_to_speech.convert_as_stream(
    text="This is a test",
    voice_id="JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb",
    model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2"
)
# option 1: play the streamed audio locally
stream(audio_stream)
# option 2: process the audio bytes manually
for chunk in audio_stream:
    if isinstance(chunk, bytes):
        print(chunk)

In Node / Typescript, a streaming request looks like:

import { ElevenLabsClient, stream } from 'elevenlabs';
import { Readable } from 'stream';
const client = new ElevenLabsClient();
async function main() {
  const audioStream = await client.textToSpeech.convertAsStream('JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb', {
    text: 'This is a test',
    model_id: 'eleven_multilingual_v2',
  });
  // option 1: play the streamed audio locally
  await stream(Readable.from(audioStream));
  // option 2: process the audio manually
  for await (const chunk of audioStream) {
    console.log(chunk);
  }
}
main();

API REFERENCE
Websocket

This API provides real-time text-to-speech conversion using WebSockets. This allows you to send a text message and receive audio data back in real-time.

When to use
The Text-to-Speech Websockets API is designed to generate audio from partial text input while ensuring consistency throughout the generated audio. Although highly flexible, the Websockets API isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s well-suited for scenarios where:

The input text is being streamed or generated in chunks.
Word-to-audio alignment information is required.
For a practical demonstration in a real world application, refer to the Example of voice streaming using ElevenLabs and OpenAI section.

When not to use
However, it may not be the best choice when:

The entire input text is available upfront. Given that the generations are partial, some buffering is involved, which could potentially result in slightly higher latency compared to a standard HTTP request.
You want to quickly experiment or prototype. Working with Websockets can be harder and more complex than using a standard HTTP API, which might slow down rapid development and testing.
In these cases, use the Text to Speech API instead.

Protocol
The WebSocket API uses a bidirectional protocol that encodes all messages as JSON objects.

Streaming input text
The client can send messages with text input to the server. The messages can contain the following fields:

{
  "text": "This is a sample text ",
  "voice_settings": {
    "stability": 0.8,
    "similarity_boost": 0.8
  },
  "generation_config": {
    "chunk_length_schedule": [120, 160, 250, 290]
  },
  "xi_api_key": "<XI API Key>",
  "authorization": "Bearer <Authorization Token>"
}

text
string
Required
Should always end with a single space string " ". In the first message, the text should be a space " ".

try_trigger_generation
boolean
Deprecated
This is an advanced setting that most users shouldn’t need to use. It relates to our generation schedule explained here.

Use this to attempt to immediately trigger the generation of audio, overriding the chunk_length_schedule. Unlike flush, try_trigger_generation will only generate audio if our buffer contains more than a minimum threshold of characters, this is to ensure a higher quality response from our model.

Note that overriding the chunk schedule to generate small amounts of text may result in lower quality audio, therefore, only use this parameter if you really need text to be processed immediately. We generally recommend keeping the default value of false and adjusting the chunk_length_schedule in the generation_config instead.

voice_settings
object
This property should only be provided in the first message you send.

properties
generation_config
object
This property should only be provided in the first message you send.

properties
flush
boolean
Flush forces the generation of audio. Set this value to true when you have finished sending text, but want to keep the websocket connection open.

This is useful when you want to ensure that the last chunk of audio is generated even when the length of text sent is smaller than the value set in chunk_length_schedule (e.g. 120 or 50).

To understand more about how our websockets buffer text before audio is generated, please refer to this section.

xi_api_key
string
Provide the XI API Key in the first message if it’s not in the header.

authorization
string
Authorization bearer token. Should be provided only in the first message if not present in the header and the XI API Key is not provided.

For best latency we recommend streaming word-by-word, this way we will start generating as soon as we reach the predefined number of un-generated characters.

Close connection
In order to close the connection, the client should send an End of Sequence (EOS) message. The EOS message should always be an empty string:

End of Sequence (EOS) message

{
  "text": ""
}
text
string
Required
Should always be an empty string "".

Streaming output audio
The server will always respond with a message containing the following fields:

Response message

{
  "audio": "Y3VyaW91cyBtaW5kcyB0aGluayBhbGlrZSA6KQ==",
  "isFinal": false,
  "normalizedAlignment": {
    "charStartTimesMs": [0, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21],
    "charDurationsMs": [3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3],
    "chars": ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", " ", "w", "o", "r", "l", "d"]
  },
  "alignment": {
    "charStartTimesMs": [0, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21],
    "charDurationsMs": [3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3],
    "chars": ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", " ", "w", "o", "r", "l", "d"]
  }
}
audio
string
A generated partial audio chunk, encoded using the selected output_format, by default this is MP3 encoded as a base64 string.

isFinal
boolean
Indicates if the generation is complete. If set to True, audio will be null.

normalizedAlignment
string
Alignment information for the generated audio given the input normalized text sequence.

properties
alignment
string
Alignment information for the generated audio given the original text sequence.

properties
Path parameters
voice_id
string
Voice ID to be used, you can use Get Voices to list all the available voices.

Query parameters
model_id
string
Identifier of the model that will be used, you can query them using Get Models.

language_code
string
Language code (ISO 639-1) used to enforce a language for the model. Currently only our v2.5 Flash & Turbo v2.5 models support language enforcement. For other models, an error will be returned if language code is provided.

enable_logging
string
Whether to enable request logging, if disabled the request will not be present in history nor bigtable. Enabled by default. Note: simple logging (aka printing) to stdout/stderr is always enabled.

enable_ssml_parsing
boolean
Whether to enable/disable parsing of SSML tags within the provided text. For best results, we recommend sending SSML tags as fully contained messages to the websockets endpoint, otherwise this may result in additional latency. Please note that rendered text, in normalizedAlignment, will be altered in support of SSML tags. The rendered text will use a . as a placeholder for breaks, and syllables will be reported using the CMU arpabet alphabet where SSML phoneme tags are used to specify pronunciation. Disabled by default.

optimize_streaming_latency
string
Deprecated
You can turn on latency optimizations at some cost of quality. The best possible final latency varies by model. Possible values:

Value	Description
0	default mode (no latency optimizations)
1	normal latency optimizations (about 50% of possible latency improvement of option 3)
2	strong latency optimizations (about 75% of possible latency improvement of option 3)
3	max latency optimizations
4	max latency optimizations, but also with text normalizer turned off for even more latency savings (best latency, but can mispronounce eg numbers and dates).
Defaults to 0

output_format
string
Output format of the generated audio. Must be one of:

Value	Description
mp3_44100	default output format, mp3 with 44.1kHz sample rate
pcm_16000	PCM format (S16LE) with 16kHz sample rate
pcm_22050	PCM format (S16LE) with 22.05kHz sample rate
pcm_24000	PCM format (S16LE) with 24kHz sample rate
pcm_44100	PCM format (S16LE) with 44.1kHz sample rate
ulaw_8000	μ-law format (mulaw) with 8kHz sample rate. (Note that this format is commonly used for Twilio audio inputs.)
Defaults to mp3_44100

inactivity_timeout
number
The number of seconds that the connection can be inactive before it is automatically closed.

Defaults to 20 seconds, with a maximum allowed value of 180 seconds.

sync_alignment
boolean
The audio for each text sequence is delivered in multiple chunks. By default when it’s set to false, you’ll receive all timing data (alignment information) with the first chunk only. However, if you enable this option, you’ll get the timing data with every audio chunk instead. This can help you precisely match each audio segment with its corresponding text.

auto_mode
boolean
This parameter focuses on reducing the latency by disabling the chunk schedule and all buffers. It is only recommended when sending full sentences or phrases, sending partial phrases will result in highly reduced quality. By default it’s set to false.

Understanding how our websockets buffer text
Our websocket service incorporates a buffer system designed to optimize the Time To First Byte (TTFB) while maintaining high-quality streaming.

All text sent to the websocket endpoint is added to this buffer and only when that buffer reaches a certain size is an audio generation attempted. This is because our model provides higher quality audio when the model has longer inputs, and can deduce more context about how the text should be delivered.

The buffer ensures smooth audio data delivery and is automatically emptied with a final audio generation either when the stream is closed, or upon sending a flush command. We have advanced settings for changing the chunk schedule, which can improve latency at the cost of quality by generating audio more frequently with smaller text inputs.

https://api.elevenlabs.io
/v1/text-to-speech/:voice_id
Convert text to speech using our library of over 3,000 voices across 32 languages.

Path parameters
voice_id
string
Required
ID of the voice to be used. Use the Get voices endpoint list all the available voices.

Query parameters
enable_logging
boolean
Optional
Defaults to true
When enable_logging is set to false zero retention mode will be used for the request. This will mean history features are unavailable for this request, including request stitching. Zero retention mode may only be used by enterprise customers.

optimize_streaming_latency
integer
Optional
Deprecated
You can turn on latency optimizations at some cost of quality. The best possible final latency varies by model. Possible values: 0 - default mode (no latency optimizations) 1 - normal latency optimizations (about 50% of possible latency improvement of option 3) 2 - strong latency optimizations (about 75% of possible latency improvement of option 3) 3 - max latency optimizations 4 - max latency optimizations, but also with text normalizer turned off for even more latency savings (best latency, but can mispronounce eg numbers and dates).

Defaults to None.

output_format
enum
Optional
The output format of the generated audio.


Show 11 enum values

model_id
string
Optional
Defaults to eleven_monolingual_v1
Identifier of the model that will be used, you can query them using GET /v1/models. The model needs to have support for text to speech, you can check this using the can_do_text_to_speech property.

language_code
string
Optional
Language code (ISO 639-1) used to enforce a language for the model. Currently only Turbo v2.5 and Flash v2.5 support language enforcement. For other models, an error will be returned if language code is provided.

voice_settings
object
Optional
Voice settings overriding stored setttings for the given voice. They are applied only on the given request.


Show 4 properties
pronunciation_dictionary_locators
list of objects
Optional
A list of pronunciation dictionary locators (id, version_id) to be applied to the text. They will be applied in order. You may have up to 3 locators per request


Show 2 properties
seed
integer
Optional
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed. Must be integer between 0 and 4294967295.

previous_text
string
Optional
The text that came before the text of the current request. Can be used to improve the flow of prosody when concatenating together multiple generations or to influence the prosody in the current generation.

next_text
string
Optional
The text that comes after the text of the current request. Can be used to improve the flow of prosody when concatenating together multiple generations or to influence the prosody in the current generation.

previous_request_ids
list of strings
Optional
A list of request_id of the samples that were generated before this generation. Can be used to improve the flow of prosody when splitting up a large task into multiple requests. The results will be best when the same model is used across the generations. In case both previous_text and previous_request_ids is send, previous_text will be ignored. A maximum of 3 request_ids can be send.

next_request_ids
list of strings
Optional
A list of request_id of the samples that were generated before this generation. Can be used to improve the flow of prosody when splitting up a large task into multiple requests.

use_pvc_as_ivc
boolean
Optional
Defaults to false
If true, we won’t use PVC version of the voice for the generation but the IVC version. This is a temporary workaround for higher latency in PVC versions.

apply_text_normalization
enum
Optional
Defaults to auto
Allowed values:
auto
on
off
This parameter controls text normalization with three modes: ‘auto’, ‘on’, and ‘off’. When set to ‘auto’, the system will automatically decide whether to apply text normalization (e.g., spelling out numbers). With ‘on’, text normalization will always be applied, while with ‘off’, it will be skipped. Cannot be turned on for ‘eleven_turbo_v2_5’ model.
