We are committed to improved support for financially vulnerable customers, staff, suppliers, and our wider community. We recognise financial abuse can happen to anyone and may also include forms of family and domestic violence or elder abuse.

Our products and services must not be used to engage in financial or other abuse.

Examples of this conduct include, but are not limited to:

making defamatory, harassing or discriminatory comments to any person, including through payment descriptions or references;
using or encouraging threatening or abusive language;
engaging in coercive or controlling behaviour, eg to restrict a person's account access or use of funds; or
promoting or encouraging physical or mental harm to any person.

We may take steps to investigate circumstances where we reasonably believe any product or service is being used in this way.

We can take action, for example to close, stop, suspend, or deny access or use of our products or services, or to block or decline payments or payment methods, if we reasonably consider it necessary to protect you or another person from financial or other abuse. This is in addition to any other rights we may have under these terms. You should be aware that we may not be able to provide you prior notice before taking such action.
