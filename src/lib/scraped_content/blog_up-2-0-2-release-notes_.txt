Pay Splitting into 2Up

Save a little for you, and now save some for 2.

You can now split a percentage of your pay directly into your 2Up spending account, with Pay Splitting.

Spell out your splitting rules from your identified salary or funding contact and weâ€™ll automatically split your payday cash to send it where it needs to go.

Automatically split your pay between your personal and 2Up spending or ANY of your Savers. Will you split off a small portion of pay, or set sail the fattest of stacks? The decision on that divide rests with you.

If you havenâ€™t yet moved your salary across to Up you can also enable Pay Splitting for your funding accounts. Or, simply ask your employer to move your pay across to Up to take advantage of these features automatically on pay day.
