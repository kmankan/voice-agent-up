Remove the weight of self‑control

Use Locked and Hidden Savers to ensure your money stays safe or hidden away till you hit your ultimate goal. Think you need that money now? Locked Savers give you a three hour delay to give you time to reconsider, or your 'accountability buddy' can unlock it earlier for you.
