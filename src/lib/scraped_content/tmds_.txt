Target Market Determinations

To ensure you're ending up with financial products designed for your needs, we've put together some Target Market Determinations (TMDs) in accordance with the Treasury Laws Amendment (Design and Distribution Obligations and Product Intervention Powers) Act (Cth) 2019.

TMDs explain:

the people this product was designed for,
our obligations around distributing the product,
when this TMD will be reviewed, and
recording keeping and reporting obligations.

TMDs are not intended to provide financial advice. When making a decision about a product always make sure you refer to the Terms and Conditions and any supplementary document(s). These will outline the relevant terms and conditions being provided under that product.

Here you can find TMDs for:

Up & 2Up Savers
Up & 2Up Everyday Accounts
Up Owner Occupied Home Loan principal and interest - fixed rate
Up Owner Occupied Home Loan principal and interest - variable rate
