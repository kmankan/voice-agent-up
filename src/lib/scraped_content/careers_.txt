Careers at Up

Come and help us feed into prosperity, not off ofÂ it

About us

Up is built by Ferocia, a technology company that is proudly part of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. We still value face to face interactions, and as such are currently only hiring in Melbourne or adjacent areas.

Ferocia hits that sweet spot of having a small company rhythm, with large company reach and resources. The success of Up speaks for itself, and we are proud that Bendigo and Adelaide Bank is carbon neutral, community minded, and committed to high standards of corporate governance.

Banking is an essential service for the advantaged, disadvantaged, and everyone in between. We believe that through innovation, empathy, and compassion, we can help the people who most need it have a better relationship with their money.

We take diversity and inclusivity seriously, so no matter who you are or who you love, we just need you to be yourself.
