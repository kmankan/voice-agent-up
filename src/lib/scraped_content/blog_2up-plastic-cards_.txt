2Up plastic cards: Our take on the make orÂ break.

Cards, 2Up

Since the inception of our digital-only 2Up accounts almost two years ago, our non-existent 2Up Plastic Cards have been in high demand, and today, we're stoked to announce that they're finally here. We know itâ€™s been a long time coming, so we wanted to say thanks to all of you whoâ€™ve been waiting so patiently. And to those of you waiting impatiently too. Cheers ðŸ˜˜

As a bank, and as humans, introducing more plastic into the world comes with some considerations, so we wanted to take the time we needed to get it right. We look forward to a world where plastic cards are no longer necessary. While that's true most of the time, there are still occasions when they're needed.

Before we released 2Up Plastic, we wanted the confidence to be able to say with conviction that weâ€™d carefully thought it through, given the significant impact plastic has on our planet. So the newest addition to Upâ€™s card family is a more environmentally-friendly option, forged from 82% recycled materials â€” packaged up and delivered in a recyclable mailer.

As an Upsider, youâ€™ll know that we donâ€™t charge any monthly fees which would usually fund the cost of a physical card, so weâ€™ve introduced a one-time $10 charge to cover the production costs. Our plan is to keep building an experience that everyone can use for free and add in some cool extras along the way that not everyone will want or need â€” like 2Up Plastic.

In addition to this, $1 from every card sold goes towards our new mates & partners at Seabin. If youâ€™re not familiar with the work Seabin are doing, theyâ€™re an Australian-based team who dedicate their time to cleaning up plastic and other waste from oceans around the globe with their innovative environmental projects. You can check out all things Seabin over on their website.

While we arenâ€™t changing the world yet, weâ€™re going to carry on down the road of sustainability and continue to support organisations like Seabin who follow the same path. Weâ€™re rapt to be partnering with their team and back them in on all the great things theyâ€™re doing in the conservation space.

If youâ€™ve got your heart set on a 2Up Plastic Card, you can order one in-app directly to your door by tapping the banner under the 2Up tab. But being that weâ€™re digital by default, weâ€™ll always encourage you to first look at alternatives to using plastic cards.

For instance, if you have a physical card linked to your personal Up account, transferring funds across from 2Up into your personal account is an easy way to get around using another plastic card. Or take the Zap Card for example, our digital money messiah â€” still #1 in our hearts.

At the end of the day, youâ€™ve got plenty of options to decide what works best for you. And no matter what decision you end up making, weâ€™re confident itâ€™ll be an EA$Y one.
