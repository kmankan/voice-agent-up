FEATURE: INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS

International Money Transfers
with Wise.

Get your money where it needs to be, hassle-free. Up has partnered with Wise to give you one of the fastest and cheapest ways to send money overseas.

Easily move money directly from your Up account into your Wise account and from there into 48 different currencies.

But Don’t Just Believe Us, Do A Comparison

Old-school transfers go through several banks, and each of them adds a fee. You might be able to see what that fee is in advance… but then again, you might not. Sometimes the fee is even hidden in an 'exchange rate', which seems less than cool to us.

Wise charges you the real exchange rate plus one small, transparent charge; there is no additional fee for using Wise through Up.

The data supplied in the comparisons above was supplied by Wise on 5/2/2025 through their Comparison API. Their Comparison disclaimer applies to the information and calculations shown. Fees and rates shown are estimates only.

How does Wise collect this data? You can read the small print here.

We base our price comparisons on data that TransferWise collects from other providers’ websites, on specific dates. Some providers don’t make their fees and exchange rates publicly available. In those cases, TransferWise use their service for bank-to-bank transfers - just as if they were customers - right until the point of paying. They do this multiple times, entering different amounts of money.

The comparison table shows how much it costs a customer to send money internationally, between the currencies specified, using each of the providers listed. It also shows the amount the recipient gets at the end of the process.

In case you want to know more, here's what all the different bits of this comparison table mean - and how it's worked out.

1. The transfer fee

The ‘transfer fee’ is simply how much the provider says it costs to use their service online. TransferWise only compares costs for online transfers from bank to bank. Telephone banking, paying from a branch or paying for a transfer via credit card are usually more expensive.

2. The exchange rate

The ‘exchange rate’ represents the estimated exchange rate for each provider. It isn’t the exact exchange rate TransferWise saw on the day that they used that provider’s service. It wouldn’t be fair to providers to show these collected rates - simply because TransferWise didn't collect all of the listed data at exactly the same time. Instead, they estimated what each provider’s exchange rate would be right now. Here’s how they work out that estimate.

First, work out the markup on each provider’s exchange rate.

To do this, TransferWise record the exchange rate each provider is offering on their website. At the same time, they check the mid-market rate from Reuters. Then, they calculate the difference between those two figures. For instance, if a provider’s rate was 1.4, and the mid-market rate on Reuters was 1.6, they’d record a difference of 0.2 (12.5%). They call this difference the ‘markup’.

Then, subtract each provider’s markup from the mid-market rate

When you see the comparison table - which might be on the same day for most providers, but could be later for others - TransferWise check the mid-market rate from Reuters again. Then, they estimate each provider’s exchange rate by subtracting their markup they previously recorded, from the latest mid-market rate. Using our last example, if the mid-market rate has moved to 2.0 when you see the table, they’d show that particular provider’s exchange rate as 1.75. That’s because TransferWise recorded their markup as 12.5%.

3. How TransferWise work out a comparison for exact amounts that they haven’t collected

When TransferWise collect data from providers, they do it using different “amounts”. So, pretending they're a customer again, they might go through the transfer process with $100, $500 and $2000. What that means, is that for some providers, the amount(s) entered when TransferWise used their service might not be the same as the one you’ve just seen in the comparison table.

This is important, because providers tend to offer better exchange rates and smaller transfer fees when a customer is moving larger sums of money. So where TransferWise haven’t collected data on the exact amount shown in the comparison table - they make sure they’re fair to other providers, by looking at the nearest amounts that they’ve got data for (e.g. just greater or smaller than the amount in the table). And when you see the table, they’re showing the cheapest transfer fee and best exchange rate found from these nearest amounts.

What all this means for you

This means that the ‘transfer fee’ and ‘rate’ you see in the comparison table might be slightly different to the ones each provider currently has on their website. In fact, the comparison table might show a better transfer fee and a better exchange rate for all the providers.
