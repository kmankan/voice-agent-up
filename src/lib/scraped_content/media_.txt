People of Up

Lots of people work on Up! Some of us are keen to chat with you if you’re after a guest post, a presenter, or a comment. Get in touch via media@up.com.au and we’ll hook you up with a star.

Neil Ang (he/him)

I’m a senior software engineer at Up. A lot of my time is spent building new features for our awesome customers, but I also love the challenge of finding new ways to make our app and internal development tools more intuitive, performant and fun. I love to code and tell the occasional bad joke.

Chris Aitchison (he/him)

As the CTO at Up, my main focus is ensuring that our amazing team has all the support they need to consistently delight our customers. I’m still lucky enough to be able to write some code and wrangle some data here and there, too. I can talk all day about culture and trust, leadership, data analytics, cycling, poker and raising daughters.

Justin Higgs (he/him)

All the gear and no idea. I’m a self confessed 'digital janitor' who loves being behind a screen. I’m passionate about branding, motion design and illustration. If there’s something that needs drawing and 2D animation, I’ll be there. I spend most of my time chasing the rush that came with taking out the Under 9’s Dingley Dingoes Lightning Premiership in 1998.

Tyson Thomas (he/him)

I lead the Support team at Up - cause I get a greater sense of fulfilment and satisfaction helping others than helping myself. I utterly enjoy motivating, managing and developing people towards breakthrough performances. Enter Up Support, shaping a humble team that strongly believes we have the ingredients to change the game Industry wide. A Support experience as kick-ass as our Product.

Anson Parker (he/him)

I’m the Head of Product at Up, responsible for leading Up’s product strategy and roadmap. I never thought I’d work in finance but hey, here I am! I must admit I love having the opportunity to put technology to work improving people’s financial well-being and making a positive impact on their lives. Originally from NZ, I worked in Sydney and San Francisco before settling in Melbourne.

Seb Neylan (he/him)

I’m a marketer originally from adland who transitioned client-side and cut their teeth online with Lonely Planet in London. Returning to Australia I got a taste for fintech at MYOB before joining the Up growth team. I’ve written for publications like Broadsheet, presented at conferences like Slack Frontiers, and lectured at RMIT. Digital channels are my jam.

Anthony Langhorne (he/him)

As an Engineering Leader at Up, my focus is on delivering for our customers through well written, easily maintained software - built to the highest standards in the industry. I’ve been making software for a long time and have loved every moment. So if you’d like to talk about any aspect of the software delivery process, say hello!

Nektarea Cameron-Smith (she/her)

Some call me “the People’s Champion.” Mainly myself, but it fits the vibe. I’m the Head of Customer experience at Up, leading a triple threat team that’s all about curating, measuring and iterating on authentically excellent experiences. When I’m not forcing people to have lunch with me, you’ll find me repping our customers with a toolkit stacked with empathy and analytics.

Sylvain Lafitte (he/him)

I’m a product designer and Head of Design at Up. I focus on understanding people to make sure we find and solve the right problems for them, and deliver simple products that are helpful, delightful, and easy to use. Originally from France, I’ve now worked and led Design teams in New Zealand and Australian tech companies such as Culture Amp and Xero.

Vera Kung (she/her)

I am a designer and product manager – I enjoy picking apart complex systems and processes and putting them back together in a way that makes them seem simple. I’m always open to talking about convoluted design career paths, sourdough baking (check out Knead for Need), or competitive ballroom dancing.

Justin French (he/him)

I’m an experienced tech leader, building online platforms, communities and teams for over 20 years with companies like Envato, Clear Grain and Redbubble. As the COO of Up, I’m all about applying a customer first approach to our business operations, and empowering teams to help customers succeed.

Lauren Mutzelberg (she/her)

As Head of People and Culture, every day I’m making sure people at Up have what they need, feel heard, feel comfy, and have input into how we grow. I’m into problem solving, mentoring and making new connections, so don’t hesitate to say hi! Currently trying to find a way to spend every weekend camping while also raising an 18mo old and avoiding daycare germs: if you have any tips, you’re my new best friend.

Xavier Shay (he/him)

I’m a veteran leader and software engineer (ex- The Conversation, Redbubble, and Square). In 2019 I returned from scaling Square in the US, to be part of building Up.

Rukmal De Silva (he/him)

I’m a marketer with an entrepreneurial bent. There’s nothing I enjoy more than testing, tinkering and scaling approaches to growth. Check the links for a bit of colour on my happenings at Up. Before the COVID I visited over half the world’s countries and harbour a dream to make it to all of the world’s regional Burns.

Brian Oakley (he/him)

As Up’s resident data and statistics nerd, I handle all things Analytics in our product team. In a previous life I decoded brain signals to better understand our visual processing system, and now I love to surface new ways Up can help people build healthy financial habits. I’m obsessed with spatial computing, virtual reality, and the intersection between neuroscience and technology.
