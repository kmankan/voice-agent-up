Up Home: Everything you love about Up, in a home loan

Jul 20, 2022

Up is excited to announce that early access is now open for its first home loan product, Up Home.

Early access is by expression of interest, and for refinance purposes only – but wider access is on the horizon. More information is available here - https://up.com.au/home-loans/

About Up Home:

Up Home is a simple loan, either fixed or variable, for owner-occupiers. But what sets Up Home apart?

More free offsets, in a fully integrated loan: your existing spending account and up to 50 Saver accounts become offsets
No application, monthly, annual or redraw fees
You can shorten the life of your loan with Round Ups, Boosted Round Ups, Pay Splitting, and all the Up features you love
Start with as little as a 10% deposit.

“Up Home is just different,” said Up CEO Xavier Shay.

“It’s less like the traditional bank loan experience and more like the Up you know and love. Your finances can feel easy again, and you can use all the Up features that already help you save and make money feel simpler.”

Up has grown fast and in only four years of operation, it’s gone from zero to half a million passionate customers. The key to Up’s success is the immense (and un-bank-like) love that “Upsiders” have for Up.

“We don’t feel like a bank because we’re not like the banks people know. We like to engage with people, make them feel great and make life easy. We’re finding that resonates and even changes people’s lives — I’ve lost count of how many Upsiders have told us that Up has helped them save for the first time.”

“With Up Home, Upsiders can go from saving their first $5 to buying a home, all within Up,” Shay continued.

Thousands of Upsiders have already started using Up’s free Home Saver product, taking the first steps towards home saving and learning about how to buy. Given its largely younger customer base, Up plans to be with its customers from start to finish.

“Most of our customers are between 16 and 25 and while actually hitting go on a home loan could be a while off, there’s a lot they can do to save and learn now.

“We’ve created a saver product which will help them save and teach them about the home loan journey, so they can successfully navigate what is likely to be the biggest financial decision they’ll ever make.” he said.

And while buying a home can be daunting, Shay said Up Home won’t be. “It feels like the Up you know and love. That’s what will set Up Home apart.”
