79.1. This clause applies if we agree to establish a “2Up” joint account arrangement for you and another person, or any request that we do so.

79.2. A 2Up may have a maximum of two persons only and you may only be a party to one 2Up at a time.

79.3. We may suspend or close the operation of a 2Up or any associated 2Up account if we believe that a person associated with the 2Up has or has attempted to be a party to a 2Up or open a 2Up account in breach of clause 79.2 above or has otherwise not complied with this clause 79. If we close a 2Up account pursuant to this clause we will do so in accordance with clause 15.3 of these terms and conditions.

Establishing a 2Up

79.4. To establish and maintain a 2Up, each person who is to be a party to the 2Up must be an existing Up customer and each person must have and maintain separate individual Up accounts that are not 2Up accounts.

79.5. You and the other person who is to be a party to a 2Up with you must both request that we establish a 2Up or agree to being a party to the 2Up before we will agree to establish the 2Up.

79.6. By requesting that we establish a 2Up or agreeing to be a party to a 2Up, you agree and consent to 2Up accounts being opened, operated, suspended and closed as set out in these terms and conditions.

79.7. We may refuse to establish a 2Up in our discretion.

79.8. If we establish a 2Up, we will open a new joint Up Everyday Account in the name of you and the other person who is a party to the 2Up with you as joint account holders.

79.9. Each person who is a party to a 2Up may open joint Up Savers through the Up app in the names of the persons who are a party to the 2Up as joint account holders.

Understanding your 2Up account obligations

79.10. Your liability under these terms and conditions in relation to 2Up is both joint and several with the other person who is a party to the 2Up with you. This means that each of you is liable both on your own and together for the whole of any debit balance on the 2Up, any amounts payable to us in respect of the 2Up account, and performance of all obligations under these terms and conditions in relation to 2Up. You should carefully consider who you enter a 2Up with as you and that other person will be joint account holders and jointly and severally liable in respect of the 2Up account.

79.11. Each joint account holder on a 2Up account may transact on, authorise transactions on and give us instructions in relation to 2Up without the authority or consent of the other joint account holder. This means that any joint account holder can transfer money or make payments using the Up app or a card, or close the account, without the other’s consent.

79.12. However, at any time, any joint account holder may request that we restrict a 2Up account so that the account can only be operated on the joint instructions of all joint account holders, by contacting us (see our Contact details above). If we receive such a request in relation to 2Up, we will restrict the account as soon as reasonably practicable such that no transactions may be processed on the account, and the account cannot be closed, without the joint instructions of all joint account holders. This means that any cards linked to the account will not be able to be used to transact on the account and electronic payments through the Up app will not be able to be processed.

79.13. We may also restrict a 2Up account if:

we are notified of or otherwise become aware of any dispute between the joint account holders affecting the account;
we are notified or otherwise become aware of the bankruptcy of a joint account holder; or
we consider it to be necessary to prevent financial harm or abuse.

79.14. If we restrict a 2Up account, we may insist on joint written instructions being provided to us, in a form that is acceptable to us, as to how the account, or funds in the account, are to be dealt with in the future before we remove the restriction or reinstate access to the account.

79.15. You agree that each joint account holder acts as agent for the other and any notice or statement we give any joint account holder is taken to be a notice or statement given to all joint account holders, except where we are legally obliged to do otherwise.

79.16. You agree that each joint account holder may have access to information about a 2Up account or any associated 2Up account without the consent of the other joint account holder.

79.17. Each 2Up account is held jointly by the joint account holders. In the event of the death of any joint account holder, the 2Up account will be treated as the account of the surviving account holder only.

Closing your 2Up arrangement

79.18. You may request that we close a 2Up account only if all associated 2Up saver accounts have been closed. All associated joint Up saver accounts must be closed before your joint everyday account can be closed. If we have restricted a 2Up account so that it may not be transacted on or closed without the joint instructions of all joint account holders, you may be unable to close your 2Up until the joint instructions of all joint account holders has been received to close the relevant 2Up accounts.
