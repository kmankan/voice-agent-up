Buy things you actually love,
with money you actually¬†have.
Save Now,
Maybuy Later.

Fresh new PJs and PS5s. New releases and once-in-a-lifetime gigs. The world is full of amazing stuff! But it‚Äôs no fun to look back with regret on the less great stuff we bought in the rush of a sale or a late night¬†scroll.

Welcome to Maybuy. A new place to save the things you crave and save up for them¬†too.

Don‚Äôt buy it.
Maybuy it.

When you find something you love online, hit the share button and add it to Up. Close tab in confidence: we‚Äôll keep your dream¬†safe.

Then pick a savings schedule that suits you. We‚Äôll show you how much you‚Äôll put away with each save, and when you‚Äôll be done. Play with your Maybuy till it feels right for¬†you.

When you make your first save, Up will schedule the¬†rest.

Keep your eyes
on the¬†prize

Maybuys that you‚Äôve set up live in the Savers screen of your Up app. Whenever you‚Äôd like to feel that warm fuzzy savings hug, you can check in on your progress, and see your upcoming¬†saves.

Bask in the light of your Maybuy treasures, and nix anything that looks a bit less great now you‚Äôve had a chance to think about¬†it.

Maybuy.
Maybuy not

When you‚Äôre all saved up for that PS5 or new parka, go buy it guilt free! But if your plans change, or you need those dollarydoos for something else, just pause or cancel your Maybuy. Cancelled Maybuy savings will return safely to your Spending¬†account.

Regrets are for Vegas, not your bank¬†account.

What we‚Äôre

Will you buy or
will you save?

Here's what the rest of the Upsider community have done, based on all completed Maybuys so¬†far:

Questions?
Can I put more money towards a¬†Maybuy?

Sure can! To add more money to an active Maybuy, swipe down on your Activity feed for ‚ÄòQuick Actions‚Äô, then tap ‚ÄòTransfer‚Äô.

Then, select your Maybuy and transfer your desired amount.

Future scheduled saves will adjust automatically to include your manual top-up.

Do Maybuys earn¬†interest?

Absolutely!

Each Maybuy is its own Saver, so once you‚Äôve activated the bonus rate for the month, you‚Äôll earn interest as you would on any other Saver üí∏

Maybuy with my¬†2Up?

You can absolutely Maybuy with your Player 2 üë≠

During setup, before locking in ‚Äòamount of saves‚Äô, you can ‚úîÔ∏è¬†the ‚Äòsave with $Player2‚Äô checkbox and each save will come from your 2Up Spending account.

Can I Maybuy a whole cart from a single¬†store?

That would be pretty awesome. Right now though it‚Äôs just individual items.

How many Maybuys can I¬†have?

That depends. Each Maybuy is its own Saver, and you can have a total of 50 Savers with Up.

So, just as an example, say you already had 15 Savers, you‚Äôd be able to create 35 Maybuys before you maxed out at 50 üí™

What if the item was sold out or a different price when I was ready to¬†buy?

Maybuys don‚Äôt reserve or purchase the item for you like a Buy Now Pay Later service would. (But also nobody but you has your money). Think of Maybuy as a Saver, with the primary focus on helping you save for something on your own terms, with your own funds.
