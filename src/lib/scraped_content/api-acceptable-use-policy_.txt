API Acceptable Use Policy

At this time the Up API is provided for your personal use only.

The Personal Access Token (“token”) provides access to your account - do not share your token with anyone.

Provided you’re using your token for personal projects it’s unlikely you’ll come up against any of the following prohibitions. The following behaviour may result in your token being revoked and/or access to the API suspended:

Sharing your token with a 3rd party (including a partner or relative)
Exceeding a reasonable request volume or otherwise attempting to disrupt or break the API service
Attempting to probe for undocumented call points or data that’s not your own
Attempting to extract data (such as merchant data) for use in commercial applications

You are responsible for the security of your token and we are not responsible or liable should your token be disclosed, even unintentionally, to a third party.

Whilst we endeavour to keep the API online, we make no guarantee around the API’s uptime/availability and we may suspend access for any reason without notice.
