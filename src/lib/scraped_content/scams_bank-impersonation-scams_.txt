CALLS & TEXTs AREN’T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM

Scammers are masters of disguise, often posing as a someone from the government, a bank representative, or as part of a big business. They can even pretend to be friends or family. With a bit of training, you'll see right through their ploys.

Spotting a scam

Impersonation scams come in many forms and can be tricky to spot. A scammer could pretend to be someone else in almost any situation that isn’t face-to-face. With the right training, you'll be able to spot the signs when communicating over the phone or through text messages. There's never a bad time to verify the legitimacy of any communication from a company to you.

They have the technology to call you from a number that can appear genuine, sometimes even sending text messages that appear in official bank threads.

They often know personal details about you and your bank account.

They claim your bank account has been compromised and to secure your funds, they need access to it or need you to transfer your money to an account they’ve set up for you.

We’ll never call and ask you for your passcode, PIN, one-time password (OTP) or recovery code.

We’ll never ask you to download software or request access to your device.

We’ll never send links via SMS or email requiring you to log in or enter any sensitive information.

Be wary of anyone contacting you claiming to be from Up, even if they know personal details like your name, DOB, address, or the first six and last four digits of your card.

Self-Defence

In a game of persuasion the power always lies with you. Take a stand against shapeshifting impersonation scammers and turn your superior brain power into your secret weapon. Detect lies in real time. Always stop, take the time to think and then act.

If someone calls or texts you asking you to move money or to provide your PIN, immediately hang up and contact us in-app via ‘Talk to Us’.

Ignore any call or message asking you to move funds or any claims that a bank will move funds on your behalf.

If you receive an SMS that claims to be from Up, always check it’s legitimate. Take a screenshot and send it to us via ‘Talk to Us’ in-app.

If someone calls or texts you claiming to be someone, always stop and verify the legitimacy of the conversation by calling the official phone number of the business.
