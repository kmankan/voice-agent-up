About Up
We’re a passionate team of engineers, designers and dreamers reinventing banking.
It started with a dream of something better

In the beginning, we were a partnership: Bendigo Bank and Ferocia.

Together we had big ideas about how banking could be better for young Australians. And together we knew we could make it real. Ferocia is a tight team, with a fierce lion mascot and international experience building best-in-class tech for banks. Bendigo has all the banking know-how and a proven way to invest Upsiders’ money ethically. We’d worked together for seven years already, and we knew there was love and trust 💕

Upsiders Assemble

We launched Up in October 2018 and it's grown at rocket speed, becoming bigger and better loved than even we thought possible. The Ferocia team is bigger now and we’ve officially joined the Bendigo family (hey, if you like it then you better put a ring on it). We now help over 1,000,000 customers (😮) and we’re still laser-focused on building the best digital banking experience on earth. We share our lunches and our bike rides, we will not let anyone win at Mario Kart, and we’re listed as one of Australia’s Best Places to Work.

We want that family feeling to extend to you. If you contact us via our ‘Talk to Us’ chat function you’ll know for sure that we’re real people, who really are here for you, seven days a week.

Our Reason for Being...is You.

It’s been getting harder for Australians to get a start on the financial ladder and make progress towards their goals. So Up reimagined things to make money easy; tools to save without stress, know where you’re at, and put your money on cruise control.

Some of our favourite bits include monthly fee-free accounts, dancing Saver pools you can fill up towards your goals, Payment Requests that make splitting bills smooth, and Pay Splitting that helps you automate your budget… even if you’re juggling casual pay, or working a side hustle. Go, you little red fire engine.

I love being able to forward payments and set up multiple savers so I can see my progress on each one... Plus, they invest ethically. And they communicate 🤯

What we’ve achieved together so far

The Upsider community is the heartbeat that pushes us forward every day. You’ve helped us to design Up and make it better. You’ve grown our family when you hooked up your mates (more than half of all Upsiders were referred by a mate). And some of you have really strong GIF game, which makes our days brighter.

In the short while since our launch, Upsiders have saved more than $205M via Round-Ups and ‘hard mode’ Boosted Round Ups, deposited more than $19B into our Savers, and sent us countless pictures of your dogs and bunnies (thank you). We have big plans — so get on board ;)

Up is for everyone. We want our app to work well for you regardless of age, background, education, race, gender, or abilities. Listening and responding to your feedback is baked into our process.
