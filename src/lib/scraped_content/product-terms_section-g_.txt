47.3. Billers who participate in the BPAY scheme have agreed that a BPAY payment you make will be treated as received by the biller to whom it is directed:

on the date that you make that BPAY payment, if you tell us to make the BPAY payment before our payment cut-off time on a business day (for payment cut-off times see clause 51 below);
on the next business day, if you tell us to make a BPAY payment after our payment cut-off time on a business day or on a non- business day; or
on the day or next business day, you have nominated for a scheduled payment to take place.

47.4. A delay may occur in the processing of a BPAY payment where:

there is a public or bank holiday on the day you tell us to make a BPAY payment;
you tell us to make a BPAY payment either on a day which is not a business day or after our payment cut-off time on a business day;
another financial institution participating in the BPAY scheme does not comply with its obligations under the BPAY scheme;

51.2. BPAY payments may take longer to be credited to a biller if you tell us to make a BPAY payment on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday or if the biller does not process a payment as soon as they receive its details.

52.1. You must notify us immediately if:

you become aware that you may have made a mistake (except in relation to the BPAY payment amount -- see clause 48.1) when instructing us to make a BPAY payment;
you did not authorise the BPAY payment from your account;
you believe the BPAY payment was not processed in accordance with your instructions (including delays);
you think you have been fraudulently induced to make a BPAY payment.

If a BPAY payment is made on your account without your knowledge or consent, liability for that unauthorised BPAY payment will be determined in accordance with clause 44. Otherwise, except as set out in this clause, we will not be liable for any loss or damage you suffer as a result of using the BPAY scheme.

52.3. If a BPAY payment is made to a person or for an amount which is not in accordance with your instructions (if any), and your account has been debited with the amount of that payment, we will credit that amount to your account. However, if you were responsible for a mistake resulting in that payment and we cannot recover the amount within 20 business days of us attempting to do so from the person who received the amount of that payment, you must pay us that amount and you authorise us to debit that amount from your account.

52.4. If a BPAY payment is made in accordance with a payment direction which appeared to us to be from you or on your behalf but for which you did not give authority, we will credit your account with the amount of that unauthorised payment.

we cannot recover that amount within 20 business days of us attempting to do so from the person who receives it; and
the payment was made as a result of a payment direction which didn't comply with any requirements we may have for such payments directions.

52.5. If a BPAY payment is induced by the fraud of a person involved in the BPAY scheme, then that person should refund you the amount of the fraud induced payment. However, if that person does not refund the amount of the fraud induced payment, you must bear that loss (and you authorised us to debit that amount of the fraud induced payment to your account) unless some other person involved in the BPAY scheme knew of the fraud or would have detected it with reasonable diligence, in which case we will attempt to obtain a refund for you of the fraud induced payment.

52.6. If a BPAY payment you have made falls with the type described in clause 52.3 and also clause 52.4 or 52.5, then we will apply the principles set out in clause 52.4. If a BPAY payment you have made falls within both the types described in clauses 52.3 and 52.5, then we will apply the principles set out in clause 52.5.

We are not obligated to investigate or rectify any BPAY payment if you do not give us this consent. If you do not give us that consent, the biller may not be permitted under law to disclose to us information we need to investigate or rectify that BPAY payment.

52.8. We are not liable for any consequential loss or damage you suffer as a result of using the BPAY scheme, other than loss or damage which is due to our negligence or a breach of any condition or warranty implied by law which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified at all or only to a limited extent.
