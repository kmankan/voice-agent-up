Buying something overseas? Our currency conversion calculator does the thinking for you. Convert the local currency amount to AUD so you know exactly what you're paying before you tap your card.

You’ll pay no fees on international purchases in-person or online. You’ll also get the same exchange rate we get from Mastercard, with no markups or conversion fees. Straight up.

When you make a purchase overseas, you’ll immediately see the amount in the local currency and in AUD, with the conversion rate included so you know exactly what you’re paying then and there.
