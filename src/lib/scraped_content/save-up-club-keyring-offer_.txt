Save Up 1000 Keyring Offer

Conditions of Use

To mark your achievement of saving up $1000 in a year, and building healthy habits, we’re offering you a free, limited edition Save Up 1000 ‘graduation’ keyring.

To qualify, you must have first passed KYC / ID verification successfully, then fully completed all 7 levels of the in-app Save Up 1000 challenge. If eligible you should receive a prize offer in your activity feed on the Activity screen in-app (shortly after completion of the challenge). This offer will commence from 9 a.m. AEDT Monday 23 January 2023, and will continue ongoing while stocks last.

To claim the keyring prize, simply tap through the in-app flow from this offer notification, and ensure your delivery address is correct. Once this flow is complete, you should see confirmation of your successful prize claim in your activity feed.

Note, this offer will only be valid for 30 days from when you first receive the keyring offer notification.

The keyring should be delivered to you within approximately 14 days, but can take longer depending on Australia Post congestion at the time of dispatch.

We may at our absolute discretion cancel this offer at any time and without notice to you. Without limiting the circumstances we may do this if:

We believe you are acting in a fraudulent, deceptive or misleading way.
We close your account.
We believe the security or quality of the Up app or related services is threatened.
You have unpaid fees or charges, or direct deposit dishonours on your account.
You don’t provide us with the correct mailing details or do not accept the offer in-app within 30 days.

If you have further questions, use the ‘Talk to us’ tab in the app to contact our Support team.
