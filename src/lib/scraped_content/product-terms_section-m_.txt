There are three types of fees and charges which can apply to your account:

Transaction fees
Other fees and charges
Government charges

This is an important section. It provides you with information about the fees and charges applicable to your accounts.

Fees and charges and Government charges may apply to your account and your use of payment facilities. You authorise us to debit these fees and charges and Government charges to your account. Current fees and charges are set out in this document.

We may change the fees and charges from time to time including introducing new fees and charges and Government charges. However, we will not introduce entry fees, exit fees or charges for the management of funds, excluding charges for the maintenance of the account. There is no maximum limit for the amount of fees and charges we may impose. If the law regulates such a change we will only make the change to the extent permitted by, and subject to, the requirements of that law.

We may at our sole discretion waive any or all fees and charges from time to time, substitute one fee or charge for an alternative fee or charge, or impose a lower fee or charge.

Unless otherwise stated, the following fees & charges are charged to your account at the time of the transaction.

There are three types of fees and charges which can apply to your account:

Transaction fees
Other fees and charges
Government charges

This is an important section. It provides you with information about the fees and charges applicable to your accounts.

Fees and charges and Government charges may apply to your account and your use of payment facilities. You authorise us to debit these fees and charges and Government charges to your account. Current fees and charges are set out in this document.

We may change the fees and charges from time to time including introducing new fees and charges and Government charges. However, we will not introduce entry fees, exit fees or charges for the management of funds, excluding charges for the maintenance of the account. There is no maximum limit for the amount of fees and charges we may impose. If the law regulates such a change we will only make the change to the extent permitted by, and subject to, the requirements of that law.

We may at our sole discretion waive any or all fees and charges from time to time, substitute one fee or charge for an alternative fee or charge, or impose a lower fee or charge.
